This project is a simple clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). The aim is to mix some what I think is great.

As a [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) user, I followed the steps from [React + Apollo Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/). But the tutorial is far from real world, I redesign and rewrite most of the code in the tutorial.

I hope that the project will be as useful for you as coding it was for me.
